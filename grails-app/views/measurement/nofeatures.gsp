        <h1>Before we can start importing measurements, we need features</h1>

        <p>At this moment the measurement importer can not be used. The reason for this is that no features are known at this moment. Please import the features you want using the <g:link class="import" controller="feature" action="importData">feature importer</g:link> or <g:link class="create" controller="feature" action="create">create the features by hand</g:link>. As soon as features are present the measurement importer will become usable.</p>
